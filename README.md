# COMP 545 & LING 782 Final Project

You will release your code on GitHub, and make it public only at the end of your project. Do not copy and paste solutions from your assignment, but you may reuse what you learned and refine it beyond what was in the assignment. You must include all the instructions either in the readme, or in a separate file that is linked in the readme if itâ€™s too long. Make sure to indicate what the TAs should be reading as you may have instructions beyond the scope of our grading. To have an idea of what you should include, please refer to this checklist: https://github.com/paperswithcode/releasing-research-code
