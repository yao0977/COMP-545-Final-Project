# COMP 545 & LING 782 Final Project

You will release your code on GitHub, and make it public only at the end of your project. Do not copy and paste solutions from your assignment, but you may reuse what you learned and refine it beyond what was in the assignment. You must include all the instructions either in the readme, or in a separate file that is linked in the readme if it’s too long. Make sure to indicate what the TAs should be reading as you may have instructions beyond the scope of our grading. To have an idea of what you should include, please refer to this checklist: https://github.com/paperswithcode/releasing-research-code

● Release usable code
● Avoid instructions that only work on specific platforms (e.g. SLURM)
● Provide self-contained instructions that are straightforward to follow
● Release code on GitHub (if it’s private, invite @xhluca or @ncmeade)
● Include instructions in Readme, or link to separate markdown file with full instructions
● Indicate what the TA should be reading
● Wrote the code in Python
● Released a PyPi package with instructions (if it’s not relevant, explain why in the GitHub readme, in a section called “Notes about release”)
  ○ For others to run the experiments
  ○ To import and reuse parts of the code as a standalone library
  ○ Can be installed via `pip` from the official PyPi
